## How To Use

**On CodeWP Platform**

1. Create a new project
2. Add your website by entering the URL
3. Go to the settings page of the platform
4. Make a new API key, and copy it

Please note, the project URL must match this website's url, or the connection will not work.

**On This Settings Page**

1. Paste the API key into the "API Key" field on the "Settings" tab of this plugin
2. Toggle the "Enable" switch to "On"

And that's it! Your website is now connected to the CodeWP platform.

You can verify this connection at any time by clicking the "verify connection" button in the CodeWP Project settings.

## What It Does

On a predefined schedule, this plugin will send information about your website to the CodeWP platform. This information includes:
- Active plugins
- Active theme
- PHP version
- WordPress version
And a few other things. Essentially, this plugin will send the same information that you see on the "Site Help" tab of the CodeWP platform.

When generating code or chatting, you can select the relevant project. The AI will then access that project's information, allowing it to generate more accurate and aligned suggestions for your work.

## What's On The Way

This is an early version of the CodeWP Helper Plugin. Soon, we'll add testing features, push/pull from CodeWP, conversational troubleshooting, and more.
