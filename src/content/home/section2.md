## What It Does

On a predefined schedule, this plugin will send information about your website to the CodeWP platform. This information includes:
- Active plugins
- Active theme
- PHP version
- WordPress version
And a few other things. Essentially, this plugin will send the same information that you see on the "Site Help" tab of the CodeWP platform.

If you have WooCommerce installed, you can also choose to send the ["Status Report"](https://statusreport.com) to the CodeWP platform.
