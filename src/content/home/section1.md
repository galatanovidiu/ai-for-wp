Welcome to the CodeWP helper plugin ðŸ¥³.

This serves as a bridge between the CodeWP platform and your website. By setting up this plugin, the connected CodeWP project will be able to provide helpful information to our AI, such as 'active plugins', 'active themes', 'PHP version', etc. This information will be used to create more accurate code and chat generations.
